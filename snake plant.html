        <img src="images/snake.jpg" alt="Snake Plant" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
        <p>The snake plant, also known as Sansevieria or mother-in-law's tongue, is a hardy and low-maintenance houseplant. It is well-known for its air-purifying properties and can thrive in a wide range of light conditions. Originating from West Africa, this plant has become a favorite among indoor gardeners worldwide.</p>

        <h3>Care Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Light:</strong> Tolerates low light but prefers bright, indirect sunlight. Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Allow the soil to dry completely between waterings. Overwatering can cause root rot.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Use well-draining soil, such as cactus or succulent potting mix.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Thrives in temperatures between 60-85°F (15-29°C). Avoid placing it near cold drafts.</li>
            <li><strong>Fertilizer:</strong> Feed with a balanced houseplant fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <p>Snake plants are excellent for improving indoor air quality. NASA's Clean Air Study identified them as effective at removing toxins such as formaldehyde, benzene, xylene, and toluene from the air. In addition to being a natural air purifier, they are highly drought-tolerant and can survive with minimal care, making them ideal for busy or inexperienced plant owners.</p>

        <h3>Common Varieties</h3>

            <li><strong>Sansevieria 'Laurentii':</strong> Known for its striking golden leaf margins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The snake plant is often considered a symbol of resilience and endurance because of its ability to survive in harsh conditions.</li>
